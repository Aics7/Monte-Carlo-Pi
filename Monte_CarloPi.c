/*BEGINNING OF SHORT NOTES
If the circle has a radius of 1, then it has a diameter of 2 meaning the length of the square is 2.
Hence, x values will range from -1 to 1. y values will also range from -1 to 1. 
Using the distance between any point and the centre, we can tell a point is not within the circle if its distance is greater than 1 
The ratio of area covered by the circle to the remaining area in each quadrant of the cartesian plane is equal
With the Monte Carlo tecnique, the higher the number of random points, the more accurate your estimation
